Story: Adding numbers
	As a Cocoa developer
	I want a method to add two numbers
	So that I can try out using rspec for testing objc code
	
	Scenario: Positive numbers are added
	
		Given a Tame instance
		And two numbers to add, 3 and 4
		
		When the numbers are added
		
		Then the return value should be 7
		
	Scenario: Negative numbers are added
	
		Given a Tame instance
		And two numbers to add, -10 and -6
		
		When the numbers are added
		
		Then the return value should be -16
